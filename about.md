# About

- After completing my Bachelor in mecahnical engineering, I have worked in my home country Bangladesh for three years. After that I came Germany for my Masters.
- During Masters I have introduced myself with the fascinating world of machine learning. 
- Then I have changed my focus in machine learning.
- I am working in industry for more than 4 years now(27.02.2022) with machine learning. I try to solve problems in industry  with the help of machine learning.
- As machine learning changes with time very drastically, I just try to develop myself. So I try to read reseach papers and do online courses.
- Right now research paper summary is not included here. But may be later I will add the summary of different research papers. This repos mostly based on my online courses.
- In case of any question please feel free to reach me.
