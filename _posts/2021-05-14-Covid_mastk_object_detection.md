# Getting helper functions from Github repository
```bash
!git clone https://github.com/pytorch/vision.git
!git checkout v0.3.0

!cp vision/references/detection/utils.py ./
!cp vision/references/detection/transforms.py ./
!cp vision/references/detection/coco_eval.py ./
!cp vision/references/detection/coco_utils.py ./
!cp vision/references/detection/engine.py ./
```

One can actually use the following commands in a command line or use Jupyter notebook. If command line is used then at the begining of the line this ``!`` needs to be removed.
So  
```bash
!git clone https://github.com/pytorch/vision.git
```
would be then 
`git clone https://github.com/pytorch/vision.git`
